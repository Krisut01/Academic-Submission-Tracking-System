Figure 3.1 Framework of the Study
    Purpose: shows the “big picture” governance model so stakeholders see how responsibility is shared from the first proposal upload to the final clearance release.
    How it works: students drive document submissions, advisers and panelists evaluate quality at each checkpoint, and admins authorize the next stage. Supporting services—validation rules, automated notifications, and re-defense handling—loop information back so no requirement is missed and students always know the next step.

Figure 3.2 System Architecture
    Purpose: explains the high-level system design so non-technical audiences understand where logic runs and how reliability is achieved.
    How it works: browsers render the Vite/Inertia interface and contact Laravel controllers. Controllers call workflow services guarded by policies. Eloquent models persist data to MySQL and file storage. Domain events trigger listeners and queued jobs that send notifications or log activity, keeping the application responsive while heavy work happens in the background.

Figure 3.2.2 Entity Relationship Diagram
    Purpose: clarifies which data records the system stores and how they link together, giving confidence that every action is tracked and auditable.
    How it works: each student (user) owns thesis documents and academic forms. Approved documents create panel assignments, which collect evaluations. Reviews and notifications reference their originating document so the trail of decisions, schedules, and feedback always points back to the correct student submission.

Figure 3.2.3 Context Diagram
    Purpose: makes clear who interacts with the thesis platform and what information flows in or out, helping clients identify stakeholder touchpoints.
    How it works: students submit documents and receive status updates; faculty review requests and submit defense results; administrators approve panels and manage schedules; registrar staff receive final clearance data; and messaging services deliver email/SMS alerts generated by the system. Each interaction reinforces coordination across departments.

Figure 3.2.4 Data Flow Diagram
    Purpose: maps the sequence of major processes so clients see how a single submission moves through review, defense, and clearance.
    How it works: the submission enters validation (P1) and is stored. Admin review (P2) creates panel assignments. Defense execution (P3) captures evaluations and feeds results back into the document record. Academic forms processing (P4) updates enrollment or clearance information. A notification/logging layer (P5) watches every step, pushing updates to stakeholders and preserving an audit trail.

Figure 3.2.5 Use Case Diagram
    Purpose: sets expectations for what each role can do inside the system, making training and acceptance testing straightforward.
    How it works: students submit documents, request panels or re-defenses, and monitor progress; faculty review manuscripts and record defense outcomes; administrators approve panel requests, schedule defenses, process academic forms, and monitor system activity. By separating responsibilities, the platform ensures each user sees only the tools relevant to their job.
